Huffman Encoding is a way to compress files by leveraging the
frequency count of the characters and using them to build a
look up tree. The higher frequency trees are coded with shorter
paths and the less frequent ones are coded further away. The net
effect is the file is smaller. The implementation here is not very
efficient. The encoding process is slow because the code scans the
tree for each lookup value.
