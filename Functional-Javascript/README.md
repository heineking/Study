### Functional vs OO

Object oriented programming tends to break problems down into nouns or objects
where the functional approach tends to break down the problem into verbs or
behaviors.

A functional system strives to minimize observable state modification. This is 
advantageous because adding functionality requires only the understanding of the
localize data tranformations. The functional approach tries to minimize
side-effects which are the source of confusion in OO approaches.

**Practical Functional Programming** is the art of minimizing state change to the
smallest area possible for the system.


**Higher order function** is a function that takes in a function an returns
another function.
