  <h2>Subheading</h2>
  <p>It is is the case that not every heading can be main heading. Some headings
    must be subheadings. Examples include:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>Headings that are less important</li>
    <li>Headings that are subsidiary to more important headlines</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Let's restate for the record</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Headings that are less important</li>
    <li>Heainds that are subsidiary to more important headlines</li>
  </ol>
